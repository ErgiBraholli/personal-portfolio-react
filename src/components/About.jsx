      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Curiosity and a love of learning have shaped my path, with technology,
        electronics, and programming always central to my studies and projects.
        I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematical and Informatics Engineering
        from the University of Tirana, with a strong foundation in software
        engineering and full stack development, including hands-on experience in
        the MERN stack. I combine analytical thinking with problem-solving
        skills to create efficient, adaptable solutions, while enjoying side
        projects, exploring new frameworks, and collaborating in team
        environments.
